                        p Flags tell a pattern how to behave.  They are used to control the mode in which the expression is parsed by the regular expression engine.  We have already seen most of these flags in use, but you should be aware of all of them. ids: undefined undefined

I am showing this table, not so that you might learn how these characters specifically work in an expression from the table, but so that you are aware of the characters themselves and briefly what they do.  We will be examining many of theses characters in the "Working With Meta &amp; Shorthands Characters" section.  For now, just acquaint yourself with the fact that these characters have a special meaning in regular expression and that the characters can be combined into powerful patterns such as what I demonstrated with the email pattern.
