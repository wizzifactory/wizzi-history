		: normal
			# The final color is the top color, regardless of what the bottom color is.
			# The effect is like two opaque pieces of paper overlapping.

		: multiply
			# The final color is the result of multiplying the top and bottom colors.
			# A black layer leads to a black final layer, and a white layer leads to no change.
			# The effect is like two images printed on transparent film overlapping.

		: screen
			# The final color is the result of inverting the colors, multiplying them, and inverting that value.
			# A black layer leads to no change, and a white layer leads to a white final layer.
			# The effect is like two images shone onto a projection screen.

		: overlay
			# The final color is the result of multiply if the bottom color is darker, or screen if the bottom color is lighter.
			# This blend mode is equivalent to hard-light but with the layers swapped.

		: darken
			# The final color is composed of the darkest values of each color channel.

		: lighten
			# The final color is composed of the lightest values of each color channel.

		: color-dodge
			# The final color is the result of dividing the bottom color by the inverse of the top color.
			# A black foreground leads to no change. A foreground with the inverse color of the backdrop leads to a fully lit color.
			# This blend mode is similar to screen, but the foreground need only be as light as the inverse of the backdrop to create a fully lit color.

		: color-burn
			# The final color is the result of inverting the bottom color, dividing the value by the top color, and inverting that value.
			# A white foreground leads to no change. A foreground with the inverse color of the backdrop leads to a black final image.
			# This blend mode is similar to multiply, but the foreground need only be as dark as the inverse of the backdrop to make the final image black.

		: hard-light
			# The final color is the result of multiply if the top color is darker, or screen if the top color is lighter.
			# This blend mode is equivalent to overlay but with the layers swapped.
			# The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the backdrop.

		: soft-light
			# The final color is similar to hard-light, but softer.
			# This blend mode behaves similar to hard-light.
			# The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the backdrop.

		: difference
			# The final color is the result of subtracting the darker of the two colors from the lighter one.
			# A black layer has no effect, while a white layer inverts the other layer's color.

		: exclusion
			# The final color is similar to difference, but with less contrast.
			# As with difference,  a black layer has no effect, while a white layer inverts the other layer's color.

		: hue
			# The final color has the hue of the top color, while using the saturation and luminosity of the bottom color.

		: saturation
			# The final color has the saturation of the top color, while using the hue and luminosity of the bottom color.
			# A pure gray backdrop, having no saturation, will have no effect.

		: color
			# The final color has the hue and saturation of the top color, while using the luminosity of the bottom color.
			# The effect preserves gray levels and can be used to colorize the foreground.

		: luminosity
			# The final color has the luminosity of the top color, while using the hue and saturation of the bottom color.
			# This blend mode is equivalent to color, but with the layers swapped.
