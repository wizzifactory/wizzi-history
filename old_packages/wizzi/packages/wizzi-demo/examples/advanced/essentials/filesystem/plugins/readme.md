## Local plugins for the filesystem store examples

<p>These plugins are a copy of the plugins described in the <a href="https://github.com/wizzifactory/wizzi/tree/master/packages/wizzi-demo/advanced/plugins">advanced - plugins</a>&nbsp; section.</p>

They are replicated here for ease of use and must be generated, before executing the demo examples, running the script:
```sh
npm run setup
```
