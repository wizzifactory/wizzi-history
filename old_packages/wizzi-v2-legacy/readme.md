# Legacy artifact generators of wizzi - v2

Required for bootstrapping wizzi - v3.

Model types generators of wizzi - v3 require two artifact generators of wizzi - v2:
* js/module
* html/document
<br />that are provided by this package.

This package has been assembled:
* making a copy of wizzi#0.0.2
* removing all references to wizzi-boot-legacy#0.0.3

How to cut the umbilical cord from previous version should be improved.
